/**
 * Manages a date-time without the time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system
 * expressed by the java.time.LocalDateTime class.
 * <p>
 * TimeControl can express the current time, the time when
 * specific processing was done, and the period of the two recorded time
 * based on the object received in the LocalDateTime type.
 * <p>
 * This class does not store or represent a time-zone.
 * Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays,
 * combined with the local time as seen on a wall clock.
 * It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 * such as an offset or time-zone.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world.
 * It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar system,
 * in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 * However, any application that makes user of historical dates,
 * and requires them to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
